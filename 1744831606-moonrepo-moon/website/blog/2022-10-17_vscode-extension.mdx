We're very excited to announce the initial release of our Visual Studio Code extension!

<!--truncate-->

If you're a huge VS Code fan like us, you most likely use extensions in your everyday workflow. We
want to enhance this experience by providing a fully integrated and interactive moon console! Here's
a preview of what it looks like:

Excited?? Want to learn more? Check out the official
[moonrepo.moon-console](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=moonrepo.moon-console)
marketplace page, or read the [official documentation](../docs/editors/vscode). This is only the
first iteration of the extension. Expect more advanced features in the future, like...

- Schema validation for configuration files
- Autocompletion for configuration files
- Automatic running/building of projects in the background
- File type association
- Integrated language server
- And much more!
