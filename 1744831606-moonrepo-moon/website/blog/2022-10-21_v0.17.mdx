With this release, we're landing the first iteration of our notifier service, starting with
webhooks! We've also spent some time working on quality of life improvements.

## Breaking changes

To start, we have a few breaking changes this release to be aware of!

### Minor changes to ID formatting

An ID refers to many things â€” project names, task names, target segments, so on and so forth. When
parsing these values, we format them to remove unwanted characters, as these IDs are used in many
contexts, many of which need to be strict.

Previously, we would remove unwanted characters entirely. Instead, we now replace them with dashes
(`-`) for better readability. Take the following for example:

| ID         | Old       | New        |
| :--------- | :-------- | :--------- |
| domain.com | domaincom | domain-com |
| build:esm  | buildesm  | build-esm  |

### Task `type` has been renamed to `platform`

This setting was renamed for a few reasons. To start, tasks actually have a
[type internally](../docs/concepts/task#types) that is not configured, but is inferred based on
what's configured. This was a bit confusing.

And secondly, our toolchain refers to language integrations as platforms, and since this setting
determines which tool to run with, we wanted to align on the platform terminology.

<Tabs
  groupId="task-type"
  defaultValue="before"
  values={[
    { label: 'Before', value: 'before' },
    { label: 'After', value: 'after' },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="before">

```yaml
tasks:
  clean:
    command: 'rm -rf ./dist'
    type: 'system'
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="after">

```yaml
tasks:
  clean:
    command: 'rm -rf ./dist'
    platform: 'system'
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

> Because of this change, the `$taskType` token was also renamed to `$taskPlatform`!

## Webhook events (experimental)

Looking to gather metrics for your pipelines? Gain insight into run durations and failures? Maybe
you want to send Slack or Discord notifications? With our new notifier system, this is now possible
through webhooks!

Simply enable the [`notifier.webhookUrl`](../docs/config/workspace#webhookurl) setting to start
receiving events from your CI environments.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml"
notifier:
  webhookUrl: 'https://api.company.com/some/endpoint'
```

> View the [official guide on webhooks](../docs/guides/webhooks) for a full list of events and an
> example payload structure!

## YAML anchors and aliases

We've updated our YAML configuration files to support extended syntax,
[anchors (`&`) and aliases (`*`)](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/yaml-anchors/).
With this new syntax, you're now able to reduce the amount of duplication required in your config
files, especially when declaring tasks, as demonstrated below!

<Tabs
  groupId="yaml"
  defaultValue="before"
  values={[
    { label: 'Before', value: 'before' },
    { label: 'After', value: 'after' },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="before">

```yaml
tasks:
  astro:
    command: 'astro'
    local: true

  dev:
    command: 'astro dev'
    inputs:
      - '@group(astro)'
    local: true

  build:
    command: 'astro build'
    inputs:
      - '@group(astro)'
    outputs:
      - 'dist'

  check:
    command: 'astro check'
    inputs:
      - '@group(astro)'
    deps:
      - '~:typecheck'

  preview:
    command: 'astro preview'
    inputs:
      - '@group(astro)'
    deps:
      - '~:build'
    local: true
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="after">

```yaml
_astro: &astro
  command: 'astro'
  inputs:
    - '@group(astro)'

tasks:
  dev:
    <<: *astro
    args: 'dev'
    local: true

  build:
    <<: *astro
    args: 'build'
    outputs:
      - 'dist'

  check:
    <<: *astro
    args: 'check'

  preview:
    <<: *astro
    args: 'preview'
    deps:
      - '~:build'
    local: true
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## VS Code extension

If you missed the [announcement earlier this week](./vscode-extension), we released the initial
version of our new VS Code extension! Give it a try and
[refer to the documentation](../docs/editors/vscode) for more information.

## Other changes

View the
[official release](https://github.com/moonrepo/moon/releases/tag/%40moonrepo%2Fcli%400.17.0) for a
full list of changes.

- Increased runtime performance and reduced memory consumption.
- Template enum variables can now define objects for their
  [`values`](../docs/config/template#values).
- Task `deps` can now omit the `~:` prefix for tasks within the current project.
- The `moon check` command can now use the `--report` option.

## What's next?

Expect the following in the v0.18 release!

- Workflow improvements for `moon init`.
- Benchmarks and performance tuning.
- Individual stdout/stderr log files when running tasks.
