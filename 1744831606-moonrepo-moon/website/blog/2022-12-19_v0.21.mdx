Happy Holidays üéÑ‚òÉÔ∏è! With our last release of the year, we're very excited to announce our tiered
language support structure, which lays the foundation for turning moon into a multi-language build
system! On top of this, we've worked heavily on bug fixing, optimizations, and overall quality of
life improvements.

## New tiered language support

The most common question we receive is whether we plan to support additional languages besides
Node.js, with Rust, Deno, and Bun being top of that list. Adding new languages is non-trivial, as we
need to build abstractions that support and integrate with the language's ecosystem, primarily
dependency managers and resolution algorithms.

This is a very large upfront cost, with a huge time and resource commitment. To reduce this burden,
we're introducing a tiered support structure, so that languages can be incrementally integrated into
moon and adopted by consumers.

The tiers break down as follows:

- &nbsp;<Label text="Tier 0" variant="failure" /> &nbsp; **No direct integration** - Tool is not
  directly supported in moon, but can still be ran using the
  ["system" task platform](../docs/faq#can-we-run-other-languages), which expects the tool to exist
  in the current environment.
- &nbsp;<Label text="Tier 1" variant="warning" /> &nbsp; **Project categorization** - Projects can
  configure their primary [language in `moon.yml`](../docs/config/project#language), and have a
  dedicated Rust crate for metadata.
- &nbsp;<Label text="Tier 2" variant="info" /> &nbsp; **Ecosystem platformization** - moon deeply
  integrates with the language's ecosystem by parsing manifests, lockfiles, and other semantic files
  to infer dependencies, tasks, and other necessary information.
- &nbsp;<Label text="Tier 3" variant="success" /> &nbsp; **Toolchain integration** - Language is
  directly supported in the toolchain, configured in
  [`.moon/toolchain.yml`](../docs/config/toolchain), and will automatically be downloaded and
  installed.

> One important facet we'd like to express, is that _all_ languages and tools fall into tier 0. Feel
> free to use anything you'd like as a task command!

## Basic support for Go, PHP, Python, Ruby, and, Rust

As announced above, we now incrementally support new languages, and have integrated the following 5
languages with tier 1 support: Go, PHP, Python, Ruby, and, Rust! Start using these languages today
by setting the [`language`](../docs/config/project#language) field in `moon.yml`, or by letting moon
infer the language based on files in the project root (for example, `Cargo.toml` is Rust).

```yaml title="<project>/moon.yml"
language: 'rust'

tasks:
  build:
    command: 'cargo build'
    inputs:
      - 'src/**/*'
      - 'Cargo.toml'
  test:
    command: 'cargo test'
    inputs:
      - 'src/**/*'
      - 'tests/**/*'
      - 'Cargo.toml'
```

> Because these languages are tier 1, moon _does not_ install the language automatically, and will
> require the command to already exist in the environment. Furthermore, the project language will
> automatically set all task's `platform` to "system", at least until it's supported directly in the
> toolchain.

## Interactive project and dependency graphs

Thanks to the amazing contribution from [Diptesh Choudhuri](https://github.com/IgnisDa), we now have
interactive project and dependency graphs when running the
[`moon project-graph`](../docs/commands/project-graph) and
[`moon dep-graph`](../docs/commands/action-graph) commands respectively.

This is only the first iteration of these graphs. Expect more advanced features in the future, like
filtering, node/edge inspection, exporting, and more!

## New `--updateCache` command line option

Our caching layer is pretty powerful, as it helps to avoid tasks from running unnecessarily.
However, there are situations where you need to refresh or force update the cache outside of the
[`inputs`](../docs/config/project#inputs) list. This is currently achieved with the
[`--cache`](../docs/commands/overview#caching) option, like `moon --cache off run ...`, but this is
non-ideal for a few reasons:

1. It disables _all caching_, which means dependency installs/dedupes will continually be ran. This
   adds a lot of unwanted overhead.
2. It requires you to backspace in the terminal to add the option _before_ `run` or `check`, as it's
   a global option. A little tedious but important for experience.

So to work around these limitations, we've added a new `--updateCache` (or `-u`) to both
[`moon run`](../docs/commands/run) and [`moon check`](../docs/commands/run), which will bypass
reading any existing cache items, but will force update the cache base on the latest run.

```shell
$ moon run app:build --updateCache
```

## New multi-status affected filtering

We support running tasks based on affected files using the
[`moon run --affected`](../docs/commands/run) command, which is great for reducing the amount of
tasks being ran, and for applying code quality tooling like Git hooks. However, you were only able
to apply a single status filter, like "deleted" or "modified", which was non-ideal... but no more!

You can now apply multiple statuses by passing the `--status` option multiple times.

```shell
$ moon run :lint --affected --status modified --status added
```

This pairs nicely with the recent
[`affectedFiles` task option](../docs/config/project#affectedfiles) changes!

## Other changes

View the
[official release](https://github.com/moonrepo/moon/releases/tag/%40moonrepo%2Fcli%400.21.0) for a
full list of changes.

- Refactored project and dependency graphs for improved performance.
- Added args and env var variants to the `affectedFiles` task option.
- Added `--minimal` to `moon init` for quick scaffolding and prototyping.

## What's next?

Expect the following in the v0.22 release!

- Generalized hashing for use in any context (improved deps installation).
- More work on language integrations.
