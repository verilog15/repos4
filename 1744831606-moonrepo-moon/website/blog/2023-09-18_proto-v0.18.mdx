Today we've got a small release that includes some helpful features.

## New `proto tools` command

Are you curious what tools you have installed? And more specifically, which versions? What about
configured aliases? Until now, you had to manually check the `~/.proto/tools` directory for this
information, but now, you can simply run [`proto tools`](/docs/proto/commands/plugin/list) to get a
list of all installed tools.

This command will list all tools that have been installed, along with their installed versions,
relevant timestamps, available aliases, and store location.

```shell
$ proto tools
go - Go
  Store: ~/.proto/tools/go
  Versions:
    1.20.0 - installed 08/24/23, last used 09/18/23
    1.20.2 - installed 01/01/70, last used 09/18/23, default version

node - Node.js
  Store: ~/.proto/tools/node
  Aliases:
    ~20 = stable
  Versions:
    18.0.0 - installed 09/03/23, last used 09/18/23, default version
    18.14.0 - installed 09/04/23, last used 09/04/23
    18.17.1 - installed 09/04/23, last used 09/04/23
    19.0.0 - installed 09/03/23
    20.0.0 - installed 09/03/23
    20.6.0 - installed 09/04/23, last used 09/18/23
```

> This information can also be represented as JSON by passing the `--json` flag.

## New `[http]` user settings

Furthermore, we've added a new
[`[http]` setting to `~/.proto/config.toml`](/docs/proto/config#settingshttp) that allows you to
configure aspects of the HTTP client, which is primarily used for downloading tools.

This may useful if you're behind a proxy, a VPN, or corporate network, and certain requests and
certificates are blocked.

```toml title="~/.proto/config.toml"
[http]
proxies = ["http://intra.net/proxy"]
root-cert = "/path/to/root/cert.pem"
```

## Index for third-party tools

Now that our TOML and WASM plugins have stabilized, we felt the time was right to start working on a
third-party index, a registry of all available tools. We've updated the official
[Supported tools](/docs/proto/tools) documentation to now include third-party tools.

At this time, the list of tools is powered by a JS/JSON object,
[which can be found here](https://github.com/moonrepo/moon/blob/master/website/src/data/proto-tools.tsx).
In the future, we may move this to a database, add filtering, sorting, and everything else necessary
for showcasing tools maintained by the community!

## Other changes

View the [official release](https://github.com/moonrepo/proto/releases/tag/v0.18.0) for a full list
of changes.

- For TOML plugins, we updated the schema internally to be represented as JSON instead of TOML,
  which may cause breakages depending on a version mismatch between proto and the plugin.
