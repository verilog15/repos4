This is a very small release that primarily adds support for the Linux x64 musl target.

<!--truncate-->

Thanks to [cargo-dist](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist), we can now build and distribute
musl binaries with relative ease. When building the binary, libraries are statically linked to
ensure that the binary can run on any Linux distribution.

You can download the binary from the official
[GitHub release](https://github.com/moonrepo/proto/releases/tag/v0.21.0) or by running the
[Bash installation script](/docs/proto/install#linux-macos-wsl). In the future, we plan to support
arm64 builds for both Linux gnu and musl.

## Other changes

View the [official release](https://github.com/moonrepo/proto/releases/tag/v0.21.0) for a full list
of changes.

- Improved file and directory locking. Will now work correctly across processes and signals,
  especially for those killed/dropped.
- Updated WASM functions to use explicit Rust enum types for versions to properly handle all
  variations (version, alias, requirement, range).
