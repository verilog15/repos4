This is a very small release that primarily adds support for Linux arm64 targets.

<!--truncate-->

Thanks to [cargo-dist](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist), we can now build and distribute
arm64 binaries with relative ease. When building the binary, libraries are statically linked to
ensure that the binary can run on any Linux distribution.

You can download the binary from the official
[GitHub release](https://github.com/moonrepo/proto/releases/tag/v0.21.0) or by running the
[Bash installation script](/docs/proto/install#linux-macos-wsl).

## Other changes

View the [official release](https://github.com/moonrepo/proto/releases/tag/v0.25.0) for a full list
of changes.

- Added a [`proto debug config`](/docs/proto/commands/debug/config) command, to debug all loaded
  configs and the final merged config.
- Added a `PROTO_BYPASS_VERSION_CHECK` environment variable, to bypass loading and checking of
  versions.
