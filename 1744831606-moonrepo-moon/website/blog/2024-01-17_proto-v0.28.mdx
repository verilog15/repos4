This is a small release that primarily upgrades our WASM runtime.

<!--truncate-->

## Upgraded WASM runtime

proto utilizes [Extism](https://extism.org/) for our WASM plugin architecture, which internally uses
[wasmtime](https://wasmtime.dev/) as our execution runtime. Up until this point, we've been using a
beta release of Extism, v0.5, which has worked quite nicely. We've also been working closely with
the Extism team to report bugs, provide feedback, and help improve the project. Once such feature
was the massive performance gains in [proto v0.24](./proto-v0.24).

Thanks to all the hard work from the Extism team over the past year, an official v1.0 was released.
Because this was a major release, it did include breaking changes around the WASM runtime, and as
such, proto WASM plugins before v0.28 are _no longer compatible_, and will need to be recompiled
with the latest PDKs. Our proto TOML plugins are not affected.

## Other changes

View the [official release](https://github.com/moonrepo/proto/releases/tag/v0.28.0) for a full list
of changes.

- Will now display an upgrade message when the current proto version is out of date.
- Improved error messages to include plugin specific information.
- Updated our "last used at" logic to avoid race conditions with the tool manifest.
