In this release, we focused heavily on environment interoperability.

## New environment aware configuration

We've made a small but useful improvement to `.prototools`, environment aware files! When the
`PROTO_ENV` environment variable is set, proto will look for an additional `.prototools.{env}` file
and merge it with the base configuration.

This is useful for certain deploy scenarios where you need different versions of tools, environment
variables, or settings!

```toml title=".prototools"
node = "21.0.0"
```

```toml title=".prototools.production"
node = "20.0.0"
```

## New `[env]` and `[tools.*.env]` settings

We're also introducing 2 new settings to the `.prototools` file, [`[env]`](/docs/proto/config#env)
and [`[tools.*.env]`](/docs/proto/config#toolsenv), both of which configure environment variables
that'll be applied when the tool is executed. This is useful for defining directory-level and
tool-specific variables.

```toml title=".prototools"
[env]
DEBUG = "*"

[tools.node.env]
NODE_ENV = "production"
```

> View the [configuration documentation](/docs/proto/config) for more information on how these work!
