## Exclusive resources with task mutexes

Some tasks may require exclusive access to a resource, like a database, file, or network connection,
but other parallel running tasks may also require access to the same resource. When both of these
tasks run, they may conflict with each other, causing one or both to fail. This wasn't an easy
problem to solve in moon, until now!

Thanks to [AndrÃ©s Correa Casablanca](https://github.com/castarco) for the idea and implementation,
tasks now support a new option called [`mutex`](/docs/config/project#mutex). This option allows you
to specify a unique name (across the entire workspace) for the mutex, which will be used to lock the
task from running if another task with the same mutex name is already running.

Take the following for example:

```yaml
# server/moon.yml
tasks:
  build:
    command: 'build-server'
    options:
      mutex: 'app'

# client/moon.yml
tasks:
  build:
    command: 'build-client'
    options:
      mutex: 'app'
```

When [`moon run :build`](/docs/commands/run) or [`moon ci`](/docs/commands/ci) is ran, both tasks
will be parallelized within our pipeline, _but_ only one of them will run at a time. If the `server`
task is running, the `client` task will wait until the `server` task is complete. This ensures that
both tasks don't conflict with each other.

This could technically be solved through task `deps`, but with a mutex, it allows you to decouple
project and task dependencies, and instead focus on a virtual resource that is being locked.

## Auto-detect base/head for `moon ci`

We've updated [`moon ci`](/docs/commands/ci) to try and detect the base and head revisions
automatically when running in a popular CI provider, like GitLab and Jenkins. For the base revision,
we'll use the base/target commit SHA or target branch, while the head revision will use the source
commit SHA or `HEAD`. This is great for pull requests and forks!

With that said, these values can be overwritten with environment variables, or command line
arguments. Below is the order of precedence:

- `MOON_BASE` / `MOON_HEAD` environment variables
- `--base` / `--head` command line arguments
- `base_revision` / `head_revision` via CI provider
- `vcs.defaultBranch` setting / `HEAD` literal value

> This functionality is provided by the [`ci_env`](https://github.com/milesj/rust-cicd-env) Rust
> crate. Please refer to that crate for supported providers, and which of them support revision
> detection (primarily the `base_revision` and `head_revision` fields).

## Include dependents for focused project graph

When running [`moon project-graph <id>`](/docs/commands/project-graph), we visualize a graph of the
focused project and all of its dependencies (other projects it depends on). However, if you wanted
to also visualize dependents (other projects that depend on the focused project), this was currently
not possible.

We felt this information could be useful, so we've added a `--dependents`
flattenDiagnosticMessageText, which will include direct dependents in the graph.

```shell
$ moon project-graph server --dependents
```

We also felt dependent information can be useful when querying projects, so have also added support
for the `--dependents` flag to the [`moon query projects`](/docs/commands/query/projects) command.

```shell
$ moon query projects --affected --dependents
```

## Other changes

View the [official release](https://github.com/moonrepo/moon/releases/tag/v1.24.0) for a full list
of changes.

- Added an experimental `moon templates` command, that lists all available codegen templates.
- Added a `runner.autoCleanCache` setting to `.moon/workspace.yml`, allowing the post-run clean
  mechanism to be controlled.
- Updated `moon generate` with better argument to variable handling.
- Updated action graph and project graph visualization to be more readable.
- Updated root-level tasks to have no inputs by default, instead of `**/*`.
