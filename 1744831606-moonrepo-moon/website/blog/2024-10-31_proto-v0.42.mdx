Happy Halloween ðŸŽƒ! In this release, we have a new bin linking strategy, and more schema plugin
formats.

<!--truncate-->

## New bin linking strategy

Early on in proto's development, we added `~/.proto/bin` symlink support for installed tools, but
chose to base it on the versions globally pinned in `~/.proto/.prototools`. We opted for this
approach as there wasn't a better solution at the time, and we merely wanted an alternative to
shims. Since then, bin linking has become an after-thought.

However, a suggestion from [@meop](https://github.com/meop) sparked a great idea for the future of
bin linking. Instead of symlinking bins based on versions pinned in `~/.proto/.prototools`, bins are
now symlinked based on all of the versions installed, but grouped according to version ranges. The
main binary will always point to the highest installed version, while we also create binaries for
the highest major, and highest major + minor combinations.

For example, for Node.js (`node`), we may have the following:

- `~/.proto/bin/node` - Points to the highest version.
- `~/.proto/bin/node-<major>` - Points to the highest version within that major range (`~major`). Is
  created for each separate major version, for example: `node-20`, `node-22`.
- `~/.proto/bin/node-<major>.<minor>` - Points to the highest version within that major + minor
  range (`~major.minor`). Is created for each separate major + minor version, for example:
  `node-20.1`, `node-22.4`.
- `~/.proto/bin/node-canary` - Points to a canary install, if it exists.

Thanks to this approach, you could easily execute commands with specific versions of a tool,
_without_ having to set environment variables, update configurations, or force overrides. Just
execute the binary directly!

```shell
$ node --version && which node
23.1.0
~/.proto/bin/node -> ~/.proto/tools/node/23.1.0/bin/node

$ node-22 --version && which node-22
22.5.1
~/.proto/bin/node-22 -> ~/.proto/tools/node/22.5.1/bin/node
```

> This change is not retroactive and will slowly be applied tool-by-tool when it is installed. To
> force relinking of all binaries, you can use `proto regen --bin` after upgrading.

## Support for JSON and YAML based plugins

Support for TOML based plugins, an alternative to WASM based plugins, was integrated in proto v0.7;
which is 35 versions ago! Since then, we've had great success with TOML plugins, as they represent
about 97% of all plugins in the registry. The other 3% is WASM of course.

However, TOML is a configuration format that is quite unknown outside of the Rust ecosystem, and has
a bit of a learning curve for new users. To ease the plugin authoring process, we now support JSON
and YAML based plugins! To demonstrate this, here's our official moon plugin in all 3 formats:

<NonWasmTabs
  title="moon"
  data={{
    name: 'moon',
    type: 'cli',
    platform: {
      linux: {
        downloadFile: 'moon-{arch}-unknown-linux-{libc}',
      },
      macos: {
        downloadFile: 'moon-{arch}-apple-darwin',
      },
      windows: {
        downloadFile: 'moon-{arch}-pc-windows-msvc.exe',
      },
    },
    install: {
      downloadUrl: 'https://github.com/moonrepo/moon/releases/download/v{version}/{download_file}',
      downloadUrlCanary:
        'https://github.com/moonrepo/moon/releases/download/canary/{download_file}',
    },
    resolve: {
      gitUrl: 'https://github.com/moonrepo/moon',
    },
    metadata: {
      selfUpgradeCommands: ['upgrade'],
    },
  }}
/>

> JSON and YAML use camelCase keys, while TOML uses kebab-case.

## Other changes

View the [official release](https://github.com/moonrepo/proto/releases/tag/v0.42.0) for a full list
of changes.

- Each tool's primary executable file name is no longer based on the plugin's identifier, and is now
  based on what's configured in the new `LocateExecutablesOutput.exes` setting.
- We now cache all text-based HTTP requests made from WASM plugins for 12 hours. This should greatly
  reduce the overhead cost of making requests, and will help for situations where an internet
  connection is lost.
