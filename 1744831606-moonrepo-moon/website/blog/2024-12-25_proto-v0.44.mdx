Merry Christmas and happy holidays ðŸŽ„! In this release, we're introducing a new terminal user
interface.

<!--truncate-->

## New terminal output

We're excited to introduce new terminal outputs, also known as a terminal user interface (TUI), for
all commands! We stumbled upon the [iocraft](https://docs.rs/iocraft/latest/iocraft/) Rust crate,
which is a library for rendering terminal output using components and JSX-like syntax. As fans of
[React](https://react.dev/) and [Ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink), this felt like the
perfect opportunity to revisit all of our commands and implement a new interface unique to proto
(and moon in the future).

Here are some examples of this new output. A lot of it is still a work in progress and will be
tweaked going forward, but we're already impressed with what iocraft can achieve!

## New `proto versions` command

After much feedback, we've decided to merge the `proto list` and `proto list-remote` commands into a
new command, [`proto versions`](/docs/proto/commands/versions). This command will list all versions
available for the provided tool, while also annotating which of those versions has been installed
locally.

This data can now be accessed as JSON by passing the `--json` flag.

```shel
$ proto versions node
...
22.0.0
22.1.0
22.2.0
22.3.0
22.4.0
22.4.1
22.5.0
22.5.1
22.6.0
22.7.0
22.8.0
22.9.0
22.10.0
22.11.0
22.12.0
23.0.0
23.1.0
23.2.0
23.3.0
23.4.0 - installed 12/19/24
23.5.0 - installed 12/25/24
```
