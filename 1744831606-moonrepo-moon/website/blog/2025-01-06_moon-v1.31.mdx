Happy new years everyone ðŸŽ‰! In this release, we've landed a handful of quality-of-life
improvements.

<!--truncate-->

## Goodbye platform, hello toolchain

In preparation for toolchain WASM plugins, we've had to rewrite and rethink a lot of the internals
of moon. Once such feature is the concept of a "platform", which is primarily interacted with
through a task's [`platform`](/docs/config/project#platform-1) setting or a project's
[`platform`](/docs/config/project#platform) setting.

We do our best to detect the language and runtime (the "platform") that a project or task belongs
to. This is important as it determines what tools to install, paths to include in `PATH`, and much
more. However, there are situations where our detection fails, or you need to be explicit, so the
`platform` settings exist.

The new toolchain system is much more powerful, but it works quite differently, so we're slowly
making changes within each release before flipping the switch. In this release, we are deprecating
the concept of the platform, and renaming everything to toolchain. The following changes were made:

- Deprecated the top-level `platform` setting in `moon.yml`, use `toolchain.default` instead.
  - Additionally, the toolchain can now be inferred from the top-level `language` setting and any
    config files in the project/workspace root. This pattern is preferred when possible.
- Deprecated the `platform` task setting, use `toolchain` instead.
- Deprecated the `taskPlatform` query field, use `taskToolchain` instead.
- Deprecated the `--platform` option for `moon query tasks`, use `--toolchain` instead.
- Deprecated the `$taskPlatform` token, use `$taskToolchain` instead.

:::warning

On the surface these two features look the same, but internally they are quite different. We've done
our best to support backwards compatibility, but there may be some edge cases that our testing suite
did not cover. If you run into any problems, mainly tasks being associated with the wrong toolchain,
please report an issue!

## Run tasks using glob-based targets

This has been a request from the community for sometime, as it fills a gap that running multiple
tasks with a non-project scope, or running tasks with a query, simply couldn't achieve. For example,
say you had `build-debug` and `build-release` tasks, and wanted to future-proof it for potential new
build related tasks.

Before this release, you would need to explicitly list all targets in
[`moon run`](/docs/commands/run) or [`moon ci`](/docs/commands/ci), but with globs, you can achieve
the same affect with 1 glob target.

```shell
# Before
$ moon run :build-debug :build-release

# After
$ moon run ':build-*'
```

Furthermore, glob syntax can also be applied to the project scope, allowing you to filter the target
instead of applying to all projects.

```shell
$ moon run '*-{app,lib}:build-*'
```

Because these glob targets are real globs, they support all the
[same syntax](/docs/concepts/file-pattern#globs) as other glob related functionality, but we suggest
keeping it simple and sticking to `*`, `[]`, and `{}`.

:::info

Be sure to quote targets that contain glob syntax, otherwise your shell native glob expansion may
trigger instead, or your shell may fail with an error.

## Task improvements

We also spent some time improving the ergonomics of tasks, our most important feature.

### Inferring inputs

Up until now, you had to explicitly configure the [`inputs`](/docs/config/project#inputs) of a task.
This can be very tedious, so we're looking into ways to automate this. The first is through a new
feature we are calling "inferring inputs from task parameters", where we automatically include
inputs from any file group token functions and substituted environment variables, found within
`command`, `script`, `args`, or `env`.

To demonstate this, here's a task that utilizes file group tokens in previous releases.

```yaml title="moon.yml"
tasks:
  lint:
    command: 'lint @group(sources) @group(tests)'
    inputs:
      - '@group(sources)'
      - '@group(tests)'
```

As you can immediately tell, there's a fair bit of duplication here. Going forward, the tokens found
within `inputs` can be omitted, as we can infer that the files defined in the `sources` and `tests`
file groups should be inputs. The task above can simply be rewritten as.

```yaml title="moon.yml"
tasks:
  lint:
    command: 'lint @group(sources) @group(tests)'
```

Useful right? However, if you do _not_ want this functionality, you can disable it with the new task
option [`inferInputs`](/docs/config/project#inferinputs) (which is enabled by default).

```yaml title="moon.yml"
tasks:
  lint:
    # ...
    options:
      inferInputs: false
```

### Always run in CI

The [`runInCI`](/docs/config/project#runinci) task option pairs nicely with the `moon ci` command,
as it does most of the heavy lifting in determining what tasks to run based on affected/touched
files. However, there are sometimes situations where a task should _always_ run in CI, regardless of
whether it was affected or not.

This isn't currently possible in moon, until now! We've updated the `runInCI` option to support a
new value, "always", which will always run the task in CI!

```yaml title="moon.yml"
tasks:
  build:
    # ...
    options:
      runInCI: 'always'
```

## Remote cache improvements

In our last release, v1.30, we released
[unstable support for self-hosted remote caching](./moon-v1.30#unstable-self-hosted-remote-caching).
While still unstable in this release, we've landed more improvements.

### Zstandard compression

We've added a new setting,
[`unstable_remote.cache.compression`](/docs/config/workspace#compression), that defines a
compression format to use when uploading and downloading blobs. At this time, we only support `zstd`
as an option, which is _not_ enabled by default.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml"
unstable_remote:
  cache:
    compression: 'zstd'
```

If you're using `bazel-remote` as your cache server, you'll also need to run it with zstandard
enabled.

```shell
$ bazel-remote --dir /path/to/moon-cache --max_size 10 --storage_mode zstd --grpc_address 0.0.0.0:9092
```

### Symlinking on Windows

In the previous release, if we encountered an output blob that should be created as a symlink, we
would simply copy the file contents on Windows when restoring instead of symlinking. On Unix, these
outputs were symlinked correctly.

The reason for this, is that symlinks require
[privileged access on Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-10/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/create-symbolic-links)
to function correctly. We felt that abiding the REAPI specification was more important than the
privileged access requirement, so if you're on Windows, be sure to allow/enable symlinks on each
machine.

### Sunsetting moonbase

Since we're migrating to and advocating for the self-hosted remote caching solution, we will be
sunsetting our [moonbase](/moonbase) product hosted at https://moonrepo.app on March 31st. All
active subscriptions will be cancelled at the end of February, but caching will continue to work,
albeit at the unpaid plan limits. We suggest migrating to the self-hosted solution before then!
