In this release we focused primarily on remote caching and toolchain improvements.

<!--truncate-->

## Improved remote caching stability

The main focus of this release was the stability of our remote caching implementation, by fixing all
bugs and edge cases, and adding support for missing or new features.

### New settings

To support new features (below), we are introducing 2 new settings,
[`unstable_remote.api`](/docs/config/workspace#api) and
[`unstable_remote.auth`](/docs/config/workspace#auth). The `api` setting defines what API format the
remote server supports and expects client requests to be sent in, either `grpc` (default) or `http`.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml"
unstable_remote:
  api: 'grpc'
```

While the `auth` setting does 2 things; allows HTTP headers to be configured that will be injected
into all gRPC/HTTP requests, and a token (via environment variable) to be used for bearer
authorization (instead of TLS/mTLS).

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml"
unstable_remote:
  auth:
    headers:
      'X-Custom-Header': 'value'
```

### HTTP API support

If you don't want or can't use gRPC, we now support the
[HTTP caching protocol](https://bazel.build/remote/caching#http-caching). This is a very simple API
that uploads action results to `/ac/` endpoints, and output blobs to `/cas/` endpoints (content
addressable storage). The HTTP API is _very_ simple and does not support any of the features
provided by gRPC, like batch uploading/downloading, streaming, or missing blob detection.

To use this protocol, set the new `api` setting to `http`, and configure an HTTP host.

```yaml title=".moon/workspace.yml"
unstable_remote:
  api: 'http'
  host: 'https://cache.yourhost.com'
```

### ByteStream support

We now support the ByteStream API for gRPC servers, which will automatically download and upload
blobs larger than 4mb by streaming chunks of data. Previously, if we encountered a blob larger than
4mb, we would abort uploading to the cache for that action, so subseqeuent runs would always be a
cache miss.

### Depot cloud hosting

Our good friends at Depot ([depot.dev](https://depot.dev/)) recently announced
[Depot Cache](https://depot.dev/blog/introducing-depot-cache), a cloud-based caching solution that's
compatible with the Bazel remote execution/caching API. We were very excited to read this
announcement, and wanted to get it working in moon immediately. It took a bit of work, and uncovered
a lot of bugs on our end, but we eventually got it working!

To make use of Depot Cache, create an account on their end, and then configure moon with the
following.

```yaml
unstable_remote:
  host: 'grpcs://cache.depot.dev'
  auth:
    token: 'DEPOT_TOKEN'
    # If you have multiple org's
    headers:
      'X-Depot-Org': '<id>'
```

You'll need to set the `DEPOT_TOKEN` environment variable on every machine that will use remote
caching.
[Learn more about this flow in our documentation](/docs/guides/remote-cache#cloud-hosted-depot).

:::info

moon itself now uses Depot Cache for its remote caching, and it has been working quite well! You can
see it in action within each pull request.

### Miscellaneous

- You can now use `http(s)` protocols for gRPC servers, instead of just `grpc(s)`.
- Added timeouts and concurrency limits to our internal clients. In the future, we will also support
  retrying.
- Added a `MOON_DEBUG_REMOTE` environment variable, which can be used to debug internal errors for
  diagnosing connection/integration issues.
- Improved handling of TLS/mTLS connections.

## Improved built-in toolchains

It's been quite some time since we've made any changes to our existing built-in toolchains, and
since there's been many updates in the ecosystem (like Deno v2), we felt it was time to do a pass on
them and introduce some improvements.

### Bun

- Added support for the new text-based `bun.lock` file in
  [Bun v1.2](https://bun.sh/blog/bun-v1.2#introducing-bun-lock).
  - We do our best to detect between the text and binary formats, but we suggest configuring
    `--save-text-lockfile` in [`bun.installArgs`](/docs/config/toolchain#installargs) to be
    explicit.

### Deno

- Added support for [Deno v2](https://deno.com/blog/v2.0).
  - Now supports all lockfile versions (1-4), thanks to the official `deno_lockfile` crate.
  - Now uses `deno install` in v2+ instead of `deno cache` that was used in v1.
  - Added a new [`deno.installArgs`](/docs/config/toolchain#installargs-1) setting.
- Added support for workspaces that were introduced in [Deno v1.45](https://deno.com/blog/v1.45).
  - When a project is within a workspace, it will now install dependencies once in the workspace,
    instead of in each project.

### Python

- Added unstable [uv support](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). Can be enabled with the new
  [`python.packageManager`](/docs/config/toolchain#packagemanager-1) and
  [`python.uv`](/docs/config/toolchain#uv) settings.
  - Right now, has basic toolchain support, including dependency installs and virtual environments.
  - Uses `uv venv` instead of `python venv` and `uv sync` instead of `pip install`.
  - Relies on `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` instead of `requirements.txt`.
- Renamed the `python.rootRequirementsOnly` setting to
  [`python.rootVenvOnly`](/docs/config/toolchain#rootvenvonly). Open for discussion on the name of
  this setting.
- Will now inherit versions from the root `.prototools`.

```yaml title=".moon/toolchain.yml"
python:
  version: '3.12.0'
  packageManager: 'uv'
  uv:
    version: '0.5.26'
```

### Rust

- The root-level project is now properly taken into account when detecting if a project is within
  the Cargo workspace.
- Project dependencies (`dependsOn`) are now automatically inferred from `Cargo.toml` dependencies
  (only `path` allowed).

## Pkl configuration now available

In [moon v1.29](./moon-v1.29) we introduced support for Pkl-based (`.pkl`) configuration as an
alternative to YAML (`.yml`), but it was hidden behind an experimental flag. Going forward, you can
now use Pkl without having to enable the experimental flag, and can remove any references to
`--experimentPklConfig` or `MOON_EXPERIMENT_PKL_CONFIG`.

Additionally, we now have [official documentation on what Pkl is](/docs/guides/pkl-config), how to
use it, and some examples of what it looks like. Check it out!

:::info

Based on feedback from the community, and our current thoughts on the configuration problem, at this
point in time, we plan to support multiple configuration formats instead of choosing one, and will
most likely include support for JSON/JSONC in v2. We're also open to other formats that may work
well in moon, and are compatible with our current codebase.

## Other changes

View the [official release](https://github.com/moonrepo/moon/releases/tag/v1.32.0) for a full list
of changes.

- Added unstable support for multiple package workspaces when installing dependencies and resolving
  lockfiles.
- Reworked child process handling to better handle signals and shutdown accordingly. Additionally,
  when the pipeline receives a signal, we now display the status that shutdown the pipeline in the
  summary.
- Reworked the new task `inferInputs` option to not infer environment variables from popular CI/CD
  providers, as those values constantly change, causing tasks to always be affected. If you would
  like to reference these values, add them as an explicit inputs.
