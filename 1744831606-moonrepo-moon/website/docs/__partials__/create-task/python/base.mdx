```yaml title="<project>/moon.yml" {4,5}
language: 'python'

tasks:
  build:
    command: 'python'
```

:::caution

Python doesn't have a concept of building like compiled languages, so these examples will reference
[project building](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/).
