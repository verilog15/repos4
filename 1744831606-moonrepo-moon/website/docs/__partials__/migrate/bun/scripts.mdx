Bun provides a built-in script runner through the [`bun run` command](https://bun.sh/docs/cli/run).
While Bun scripts are great, they're not as efficient as moon. They _do not_ support granular
inputs, smart hashing, incremental caching, and all the other performance benefits that moon
provides.

With that being said, you _do not_ have to migrate away from Bun scripts. Instead, you can simply
run them from within moon tasks. This gives you the best of both worlds.

```yaml title="<project>/moon.yml"
language: 'typescript'

tasks:
  analyze:
    command: 'bun run analyze'
    inputs:
      - '@globs(sources)'
      - '@globs(tests)'
```

> When Bun scripts are ran through moon tasks, the current working directory is set to the project
> root.
