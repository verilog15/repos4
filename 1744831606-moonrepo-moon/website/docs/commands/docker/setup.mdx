The `moon docker setup` command will efficiently install dependencies for focused projects. This is
an all-in-one command for tool and dependency installations, and should replace `npm install` and
other commands.

```shell
$ moon docker setup
```

:::info

View the official [Docker usage guide](../../guides/docker) for a more in-depth example of how to
utilize this command.

:::

:::caution

This command _must be_ ran after [`moon docker scaffold`](./scaffold) and is typically ran within a
`Dockerfile`! The [`moon docker file`](./file) command can be used to generate a `Dockerfile`.

### Configuration

- [`*`](../../config/toolchain) in `.moon/toolchain.yml`
