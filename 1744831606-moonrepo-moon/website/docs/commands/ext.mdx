The `moon ext <id>` command will execute an extension (a WASM plugin) that has been configured with
the [`extensions`](../config/workspace#extensions) setting in [`.moon/workspace.yml`](../config).
View our official [extensions guide](../guides/extensions) for more information.

```shell
$ moon ext download -- --url https://github.com/moonrepo/moon/archive/refs/tags/v1.19.3.zip
```

Extensions typically support command line arguments, which _must_ be passed after a `--` separator
(as seen above). Any arguments before the separator will be passed to the `moon ext` command itself.

:::caution

This command requires an internet connection if the extension's `.wasm` file must be downloaded from
a URL, and it hasn't been cached locally.

:::

### Arguments

- `<id>` - Name of the extension to execute.
- `[-- <args>]` - Arguments to pass to the extension.

### Configuration

- [`extensions`](../config/workspace#extensions) in `.moon/workspace.yml`
