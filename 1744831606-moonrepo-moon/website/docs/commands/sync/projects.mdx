The `moon sync projects` command will force sync _all_ projects in the workspace to help achieve a
[healthy repository state](../../faq#what-should-be-considered-the-source-of-truth). This applies
the following:

- Ensures cross-project dependencies are linked based on
  [`dependsOn`](../../config/project#dependson).
- Ensures language specific configuration files are present and accurate (`package.json`,
  `tsconfig.json`, etc).
- Ensures root configuration and project configuration are in sync.
- Any additional language specific semantics that may be required.

```shell
$ moon sync projects
```

> This command should rarely be ran, as [`moon run`](../run) will sync affected projects
> automatically! However, when migrating or refactoring, manual syncing may be necessary.

### Configuration

- [`projects`](../../config/workspace#projects) in `.moon/workspace.yml`
