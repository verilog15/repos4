title: teardown
---

The `moon teardown` command, as its name infers, will teardown and clean the current environment,
opposite the [`setup`](./setup) command. It achieves this by doing the following:

- Uninstalling all configured tools in the toolchain.
- Removing any download or temporary files/folders.

```shell
$ moon teardown
```

### Configuration

- [`*`](../config/toolchain) in `.moon/toolchain.yml`
