title: Workspace
---

A workspace is a directory that contains [projects](./project), manages a [toolchain](./toolchain),
runs [tasks](./task), and is coupled with a VCS repository. The root of a workspace is denoted by a
`.moon` folder.

By default moon has been designed for monorepos, but can also be used for polyrepos.

## Configuration

Configuration that's applied to the entire workspace is defined in
[`.moon/workspace.yml`](../config/workspace).
