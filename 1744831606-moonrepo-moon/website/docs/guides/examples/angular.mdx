In this guide, you'll learn how to integrate [Angular](https://angular.io/) into moon.

Begin by creating a new Angular project in the root of an existing moon project (this should not be
created in the workspace root, unless a polyrepo).

```shell
cd apps && npx -p @angular/cli@latest ng new angular-app
```

> View the [official Angular docs](https://angular.io/start) for a more in-depth guide to getting
> started!

## Setup

Since Angular is per-project, the associated moon tasks should be defined in each project's
[`moon.yml`](../../config/project) file.

```yaml title="<project>/moon.yml"
fileGroups:
  app:
    - 'src/**/*'
    - 'angular.*'

tasks:
  dev:
    command: 'ng serve'
    local: true

  build:
    command: 'ng build'
    inputs:
      - '@group(app)'
      - '@group(sources)'
    outputs:
      - 'dist'

  # Extends the top-level lint
  lint:
    args:
      - '--ext'
      - '.ts'
```

### ESLint integration

Angular does not provide a built-in linting abstraction, but instead there is an
[ESLint package](https://github.com/angular-eslint/angular-eslint), which is great, but complicates
things a bit. Because of this, you have two options for moving forward:

- Use a [global `lint` task](./eslint) and bypass Angular's solution (preferred).
- Use Angular's ESLint package solution only.

Regardless of which option is chosen, the following changes are applicable to all options and should
be made. Begin be installing the dependencies that the
[`@angular-eslint`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/eslint#eslint-config) package need in the
application's `package.json`.

<AddDepsTabs
  dep="@angular-eslint/builder @angular-eslint/eslint-plugin @angular-eslint/eslint-plugin-template @angular-eslint/schematics @angular-eslint/template-parser"
  package="<project>"
  dev
/>

Since Angular has some specific rules, we'll need to tell the ESLint package to overrides the
default ones. This can be achieved with a project-level `.eslintrc.json` file.

```json title="<project>/.eslintrc.json"
{
  "root": true,
  "ignorePatterns": ["projects/**/*"],
  "overrides": [
    {
      "files": ["*.ts"],
      "extends": [
        "eslint:recommended",
        "plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended",
        "plugin:@angular-eslint/recommended",
        // This is required if you use inline templates in Components
        "plugin:@angular-eslint/template/process-inline-templates"
      ],
      "rules": {
        /**
         * Any TypeScript source code (NOT TEMPLATE) related rules you wish to use/reconfigure over and above the
         * recommended set provided by the @angular-eslint project would go here.
         */
        "@angular-eslint/directive-selector": [
          "error",
          { "type": "attribute", "prefix": "app", "style": "camelCase" }
        ],
        "@angular-eslint/component-selector": [
          "error",
          { "type": "element", "prefix": "app", "style": "kebab-case" }
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "files": ["*.html"],
      "extends": [
        "plugin:@angular-eslint/template/recommended",
        "plugin:@angular-eslint/template/accessibility"
      ],
      "rules": {
        /**
         * Any template/HTML related rules you wish to use/reconfigure over and above the
         * recommended set provided by the @angular-eslint project would go here.
         */
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

With the basics now setup, choose the option that works best for you.

<Tabs
  groupId="lint-type"
  defaultValue="global"
  values={[
    { label: 'Global lint', value: 'global' },
    { label: 'Angular lint', value: 'angular' },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="global">

We encourage using the global `lint` task for consistency across all projects within the repository.
With this approach, the `eslint` command itself will be ran and the `ng lint` command will be
ignored, but the `@angular-eslint` rules will still be used.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="angular">

If you'd prefer to use the `ng lint` command, add it as a task to the project's
[`moon.yml`](../../config/project).

```yaml title="<project>/moon.yml"
tasks:
  lint:
    command: 'ng lint'
    inputs:
      - '@group(angular)'
```

Furthermore, if a global `lint` task exists, be sure to exclude it from being inherited.

```yaml title="<project>/moon.yml"
workspace:
  inheritedTasks:
    exclude: ['lint']
```

In addition to configuring `moon.yml`, you also need to add a lint target in the `angular.json` file
for linting to work properly. The lint target specifies which builder to use for linting, as well as
the file patterns that should be linted.

```json title="<project>/angular.json"
{
  "projects": {
    "angular-app": {
      "architect": {
        "lint": {
          "builder": "@angular-eslint/builder:lint",
          "options": {
            "lintFilePatterns": ["src/**/*.ts", "src/**/*.html"]
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Adding this lint target is crucial for ensuring that the linting process is properly configured and
integrated with Angular's build system.

</Tabs>

### TypeScript integration

Angular has [built-in support for TypeScript](https://angular.io/guide/typescript-configuration), so
there is no need for additional configuration to enable TypeScript support.

At this point we'll assume that a `tsconfig.json` has been created in the application, and
typechecking works. From here we suggest utilizing a [global `typecheck` task](./typescript) for
consistency across all projects within the repository.

## Configuration

### Root-level

We suggest _against_ root-level configuration, as Angular should be installed per-project, and the
`ng` command expects the configuration to live relative to the project root.

### Project-level

When creating a new Angular project, a [`angular.json`](https://angular.io/guide/workspace-config)
is created, and _must_ exist in the project root. This allows each project to configure Angular for
their needs.

```json title="<project>/angular.json"
{
  "$schema": "./node_modules/@angular/cli/lib/config/schema.json",
  "version": 1,
  "projects": {
    "angular-app": {
      "projectType": "application",
      ...
    }
  },
  ...
}
```
