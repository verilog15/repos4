In this guide, you'll learn how to integrate [Astro](https://docs.astro.build).

Begin by creating a new Astro project in the root of an existing moon project (this should not be
created in the workspace root, unless a polyrepo).

```shell
cd apps && npm create astro@latest
```

## Setup

Since Astro is per-project, the associated moon tasks should be defined in each project's
[`moon.yml`](../../config/project) file.

:::tip

We suggest inheriting Astro tasks from the
[official moon configuration preset](https://github.com/moonrepo/moon-configs/tree/master/javascript/astro).

:::

```yaml title="<project>/moon.yml"
# Inherit tasks from the `astro` preset
# https://github.com/moonrepo/moon-configs
tags: ['astro']

# Disable project references
toolchain:
  typescript:
    syncProjectReferences: false
```

### ESLint integration

When using a [`lint`](./eslint) task, the
[`eslint-plugin-astro`](https://ota-meshi.github.io/eslint-plugin-astro/user-guide/) package must be
installed to lint `.astro` files.

<AddDepsTabs dev dep="eslint-plugin-astro" package="<app>" />

Once the dependency has been installed in the application's `package.json`. We can then enable this
configuration by creating an `.eslintrc.js` file in the project root. Be sure this file is listed in
your lint task's inputs!

```js title="<project>/.eslintrc.js"
module.exports = {
  extends: ['plugin:astro/recommended'],
  overrides: [
    {
      files: ['*.astro'],
      parser: 'astro-eslint-parser',
      // If using TypeScript
      parserOptions: {
        parser: '@typescript-eslint/parser',
        extraFileExtensions: ['.astro'],
        project: 'tsconfig.json',
        tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

And lastly, when linting through moon's command line, you'll need to include the `.astro` extension
within the `lint` task. This can be done by extending the top-level task within the project (below),
or by adding it to the top-level entirely.

```yaml title="<project>/moon.yml"
tasks:
  lint:
    args:
      - '--ext'
      - '.ts,.tsx,.astro'
```

### Prettier integration

When using a [`format`](./prettier) task, the `prettier-plugin-astro` package must be installed to
format `.astro` files. View the official
[Astro docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/editor-setup/#prettier) for more information.

<AddDepsTabs dev dep="prettier-plugin-astro" package="<app>" />

### TypeScript integration

Since Astro utilizes custom `.astro` files, it requires a specialized TypeScript integration, and
luckily Astro provides an [in-depth guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/typescript/). With
that being said, we do have a few requirements and pointers!

- Use the official [Astro `tsconfig.json`](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/typescript/#setup) as
  a basis.
- From our internal testing, the `astro check` command (that typechecks `.astro` files) _does not
  support project references_. If the `composite` compiler option is enabled, the checker will fail
  to find `.astro` files. To work around this, we disable `workspace.typescript` in our moon config
  above.
- Since typechecking requires 2 commands, one for `.astro` files, and the other for `.ts`, `.tsx`
  files, we've added the [`typecheck`](./typescript) task as a dependency for the `check` task. This
  will run both commands through a single task!

## Configuration

### Root-level

We suggest _against_ root-level configuration, as Astro should be installed per-project, and the
`astro` command expects the configuration to live relative to the project root.

### Project-level

When creating a new Astro project, a
[`astro.config.mjs`](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/configuration-reference/) is created, and
_must_ exist in the project root. This allows each project to configure Astro for their needs.

```js title="<project>/astro.config.mjs"
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';

// https://astro.build/config
export default defineConfig({});
```
