Storybook is a frontend workshop for building UI components and pages in isolation. Thousands of
teams use it for UI development, testing, and documentation. Itâ€™s open source and free.

[Storybook v7](https://storybook.js.org/docs/7.0) is typically coupled with
[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). To scaffold a new Storybook project with Vite, run the following
command in a project root. This guide assumes you are using React, however it is possible to use
almost any (meta) framework with Storybook.

```shell
cd <project> && npx storybook init
```

> We highly suggest reading our documentation on [using Vite (and Vitest) with moon](./vite) and
> [using Jest with moon](./jest) for a more holistic view.

## Setup

This section assumes Storybook is being used with Vite, and is integrated on a per-project basis.

After setting up Storybook, ensure [`moon.yml`](../../config/project) has the following tasks:

```yaml title="<project>/moon.yml"
fileGroups:
  storybook:
    - 'src/**/*'
    - 'stories/**/*'
    - 'tests/**/*'
    - '.storybook/**/*'

tasks:
  buildStorybook:
    command: 'build-storybook --output-dir @out(0)'
    inputs:
      - '@group(storybook)'
    outputs:
      - 'build'

  storybook:
    local: true
    command: 'start-storybook'
    inputs:
      - '@group(storybook)'
```

To run the Storybook development server:

```shell
moon run <project>:storybook
```

### Vite integration

Storybook 7 uses Vite out of the box, and as such, no configuration is required, but should you
choose to extend the Vite config, you can do so by passing in `viteFinal`:

```ts title=".storybook/main.ts"
import { mergeConfig } from 'vite';

export default {
  stories: ['../stories/**/*.stories.mdx', '../stories/**/*.stories.@(js|jsx|ts|tsx)'],
  addons: ['@storybook/addon-links', '@storybook/addon-essentials'],
  core: {
    builder: '@storybook/builder-vite',
  },
  async viteFinal(config) {
    // Merge custom configuration into the default config
    return mergeConfig(config, {
      // Use the same "resolve" configuration as your app
      resolve: (await import('../vite.config.js')).default.resolve,
      // Add dependencies to pre-optimization
      optimizeDeps: {
        include: ['storybook-dark-mode'],
      },
    });
  },
};
```

For more information on how to integrate Vite with Storybook see the
[relevant documentation](https://storybook.js.org/docs/7.0/react/builders/vite#configuration).

### Webpack integration

If you want to use Webpack with your Storybook project, you can do so by installing the relevant
package and updating configuration.

<AddDepsTabs dev dep="@storybook/builder-webpack5" package="<project>" />

```ts title=".storybook/main.ts"
export default {
  core: {
    builder: '@storybook/builder-webpack5',
  },
};
```

For more information on how to integrate Webpack with Storybook, see the
[relevant documentation](https://storybook.js.org/docs/7.0/react/builders/webpack).

### Jest integration

You can use Jest to test your stories, but isn't a requirement. Storybook ships with first-party
plugins for improved developer experience.

Install the test runner and any relevant packages:

<AddDepsTabs
  dev
  dep="@storybook/addon-interactions @storybook/addon-coverage @storybook/jest@next @storybook/testing-library@next @storybook/test-runner@next"
  package="<project>"
/>

Add the test task to your project:

```yaml title="<project>/moon.yml"
tasks:
  testStorybook:
    command: 'test-storybook'
    inputs:
      - '@group(storybook)'
```

Then enable plugins and interactions in your Storybook project:

```ts title=".storybook/main.ts"
export default {
  stories: ['../src/**/*.stories.mdx', '../src/**/*.stories.@(js|jsx|ts|tsx)'],
  addons: [
    // Other Storybook addons
    '@storybook/addon-interactions', // Addon is registered here
    '@storybook/addon-coverage',
  ],
  features: {
    interactionsDebugger: true, // Enable playback controls
  },
};
```

You can now start writing your tests. For an extended guide on how to write tests within your
stories, see
[writing an interaction test](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-tests/interaction-testing#write-an-interaction-test)
on the Storybook docs.

## Configuration

Storybook requires a `.storybook` folder relative to the project root. Because of this, Storybook
should be scaffolded in each project individually. Configuration may be shared through package
imports.
