The `proto diagnose` command will diagnose your proto installation for any potential issues. Issues
are categorized into errors and warnings, with the former being a must fix, and the latter being a
maybe fix (depending on your usage of proto).

```
$ proto diagnose

Shell: zsh
Shell profile: /Users/name/.zshrc

Errors ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  - Issue: Bin directory /Users/name/.proto/bin was found BEFORE the shims directory /Users/name/.proto/shims on PATH
    Resolution: Ensure the shims path comes before the bin path in your shell
    Comment: Runtime version detection will not work correctly unless shims are used
```

### Options

- `--shell` - The shell to diagnose (will detect automatically).
- `--json` - Print the diagnosis in JSON format.
