The `proto regen` command can be used to regenerate all shims in the `~/.proto/shims` directory.
This command will also clean the shims directory before regenerating, in an effort to remove
unexpected or broken shims.

```shell
$ proto regen
```

By default this will only regenerate shims. If you want to regenerate bins in `~/.proto/bin` as
well, pass the `--bin` flag. This will also clean the bins directory before regenerating.

```shell
$ proto regen --bin
```

> Only versions pinned in `~/.proto/.prototools` will be linked as bins.

## Options

- `--bin` - Also recreate `~/.proto/bin` symlinks.
