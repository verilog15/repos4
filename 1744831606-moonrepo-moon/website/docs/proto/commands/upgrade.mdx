import VersionLabel from '@site/src/components/Docs/VersionLabel';

The `proto upgrade` (or `proto up`) command can be used to upgrade your current proto binary to the
latest version, or check if you're currently outdated.

```shell
$ proto upgrade

# Up/downgrade to a specific version
$ proto upgrade 0.39.0
```

:::info

The previous binary will be moved to `~/.proto/tools/proto/<version>`, while the new binary will be
installed to `~/.proto/bin`.

:::

### Arguments

- `<version>` - The version of proto to explicitly upgrade or downgrade to.
  <VersionLabel version="0.39.3" />

### Options

- `--check` - Check if there's a new version without executing the upgrade.
- `--json` - Print the upgrade information as JSON.
