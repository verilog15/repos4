It can be very time-consuming to create a good looking floorplan. So be prepared before you start.

A good piece of software with awesome assets is [Floorplanner](https://floorplanner.com) `Not sponsored`. Please keep in mind that Floorplanner will ask for a few bucks, if you would like to export the render in higher quality.
