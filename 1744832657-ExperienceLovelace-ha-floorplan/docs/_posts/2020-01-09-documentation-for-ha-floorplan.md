Wuhuu!ðŸ¥³ Welcome to the official documentation for ha-floorplan. We hope you'll find it usefull, while playing around with our custom module for Home Assistant.

Please keep in mind that we're still working on the docs. Many pages has a very limited about of content, but it will get better down the line - we promise!

## Home Assistant Community

We're also on the official [Home Assistant Community][homeassistant-community], so feel free to join us there, too. But please keep in mind that it's just better to reach out, in the [Discussion][discussion-github]-area.
