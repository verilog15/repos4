If you're searching for the latest version of ha-floorplan, please head over to the [Releases page on GitHub](https://github.com/ExperienceLovelace/ha-floorplan/releases).

But please keep in mind that we're fully supported by HACS. It's already a good idea to use that, for better handling of custom modules to Home Assistant. Updates are almost as simple as a single click, too. Read more about how to do it the HACS-way, in our [Quick Start](./docs/quick-start/)-guide.
