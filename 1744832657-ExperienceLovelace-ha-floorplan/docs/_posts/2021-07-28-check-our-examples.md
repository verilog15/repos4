In the last couple of months, we've released a few new examples. Check out the [remote control](https://experiencelovelace.github.io/ha-floorplan/docs/example-remote/), and the [modern floorplan](https://experiencelovelace.github.io/ha-floorplan/docs/example-floorplanner-home/).

If you've though about creating a SVG-files with multiple layers, also known as floors, that's now possible. Go visit the [multiple floors example](https://experiencelovelace.github.io/ha-floorplan/docs/example-multi-floor/) to learn more.

Remember to check out the [examples](https://github.com/ExperienceLovelace/ha-floorplan/tree/master/docs/_docs/floorplan/examples) section on GitHub too, if you're searching for the source-files. It's also a good idea to visit our [Usage](https://experiencelovelace.github.io/ha-floorplan/docs/usage/)-page, if you're searching for even more knowledge.

Thank you for using our floorplan solution! You're always welcome to join our [community](https://github.com/ExperienceLovelace/ha-floorplan/discussions).
