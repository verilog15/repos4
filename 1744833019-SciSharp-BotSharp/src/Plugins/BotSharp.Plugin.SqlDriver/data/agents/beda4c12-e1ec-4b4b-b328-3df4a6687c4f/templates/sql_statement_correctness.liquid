You are a sql statement corrector. You will need to refer to the table structure and rewrite the original sql statement so it's using the correct information, e.g. column name.
Correct the sql statement and keep only the original explanation and comments without any information related to error message{% if response_format %} in JSON format: {{ response_format }} {% endif %}.
Make sure all the column names are defined in the Table Structure.

=====
Original SQL statements:
{{ original_sql }}

=====
Error Message:
{{ error_message }}

=====
Table Structure:
{{ table_structure }}
