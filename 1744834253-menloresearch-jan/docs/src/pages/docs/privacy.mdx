# Privacy

Jan is an app that allows you to own your AI. We prioritize local AI models and your control over your data. This page explains what data we collect and why. No tricks.

<Callout>
For a comprehensive overview of our privacy practices, you can read our full [Privacy Policy](/docs/privacy-policy).
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
We don't collect any data until you explicitly allow tracking. 
</Callout>

You'll be asked about your tracking preferences when you first launch the app, and you can change them at any time in Settings.

Regardless of your analytics permissions, Jan will **never** access your chat history, chat settings, or the language models you have used.

## Why and what we track

To build a reliable, user-friendly AI that you own, we need to understand how Jan is used. If users allowed us to track, we collect product analytics data.

### Product Analytics

We track data like how often the app is opened to check:

- **Active Users**: How many people use Jan daily to measure engagement
- **Retention Rates**: To understand if users are finding value in Jan over time

Product analytics data is tied to a randomly generated user ID. None of our usage data can be linked to your personal identity. Your chat history and personal data are never tracked.

## What we **DO NOT** track

<Callout type="info">
Even if you grant analytics permissions, Jan doesn't track many of your private activities. 
</Callout>

- We don't track your conversations with Jan.
- We don't scan, upload, or look at your files.
- We don't collect anything tied to your identity.
- We don't track your prompts and prompt templates.
- We don't monitor context length or conversation length.
- We don't track the models you have used or their types.

You store the files and logs that are a priority for your privacy yourself. 

## Using Cloud Models

Jan allows you to connect cloud model APIs. If you choose to use cloud-based models (e.g. GPT, Claude models), the API provider handling the model will have access to your messages as part of processing the request. Again, Jan doesn't see or store these messages - they go directly to the provider. Remember: With local models, everything stays on your device, so no one - not even us- can see your messages.

## Where we store & process data
We use [PostHog](https://posthog.com/eu) EU for analytics, ensuring all data is processed within the European Union. This setup complies with GDPR and other strict privacy regulations. PostHog lets us securely manage the data we collect. Read more [on PostHog's GDPR doc](https://posthog.com/docs/privacy/gdpr-compliance).
