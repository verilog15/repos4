</Steps>

## Available DeepSeek Models

Jan automatically includes DeepSeek's available models. In case you want to use a specific DeepSeek model that you cannot find in **Jan**, follow instructions in [Add Cloud Models](/docs/models/manage-models#add-models-1):
  - See list of available models in [DeepSeek Models](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/quick_start/pricing).
  - The `id` property must match the model name in the list. For example, `deepseek-chat` or `deepseek-reasoner`.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

**1. API Key Issues**
- Verify your API key is correct and not expired
- Check if you have billing set up on your DeepSeek account
- Ensure you have access to the model you're trying to use

**2. Connection Problems**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify [DeepSeek's system status](https://status.deepseek.com/)
- Look for error messages in [Jan's logs](/docs/troubleshooting#how-to-get-error-logs)

**3. Model Unavailable**
- Confirm your API key has access to the model
- Check if you're using the correct model ID
- Verify your DeepSeek account has the necessary permissions
