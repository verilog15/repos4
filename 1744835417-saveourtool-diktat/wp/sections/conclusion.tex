\par DiKTat is a static code analyzer that finds and fixes code style inconsistencies. DiKTat is configurable, easy-to-use and it implements CI/CD pipelines, which distinguishes it from analogues. We offer many convenient ways to use diktat in projects, so you can use it as Maven/Gradle plugin, CLI tool, Web or github actions. It supports more than 100 rules, where each of them has clear explanation and can be configured by user. For diktat we have instroduced the coding convention for Kotlin code that now has 6 chapters and will be extended in the future.
\par When the development of diKTat will be finished, we are going to support rules, update frameworks and track latest Kotlin releases to keep diKTat up to date. We are also planning to implement some number of Inspections that can detect real bugs in Kotlin code.
