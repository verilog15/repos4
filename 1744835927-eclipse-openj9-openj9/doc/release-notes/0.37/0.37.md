# Eclipse OpenJ9 version 0.37.0 release notes

These release notes support the [Eclipse OpenJ9&trade; 0.37.0 release plan](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.openj9/releases/0.37.0/plan).

## Supported environments

OpenJ9 release 0.37.0 works with OpenJDK 19. OpenJDK 19 is out of support at the time of the 0.37.0 release. Builds of 0.37.0 should not be used in production and might contain known security vulnerabilities as of 18 April 2023.

All releases are tested against the OpenJ9 functional verification (FV) test suite, the OpenJDK test suites, and additional tests provided by Adoptium.

For a list of JDK Enhancement Proposals (JEP) that are supported by or implemented in OpenJ9, see the [release topic](https://eclipse.org/openj9/docs/version0.37/#new-jdk-19-features) in the user documentation.

To learn more about support for OpenJ9 releases, including OpenJDK levels and platform support, see [Supported environments](https://eclipse.org/openj9/docs/openj9_support/index.html).

## Notable changes in this release

The following table covers notable changes in v0.37.0. Further information about these changes can be found in the [user documentation](https://www.eclipse.org/openj9/docs/version0.37/).

<td valign="top">OpenJDK 11 and later (Linux on IBM Z)</td>
<td valign="top">On restarting an application, or creating or removing of tokens, the token might move to a different slot. An application that uses the <tt>slot</tt> or <tt>slotListIndex</tt> attributes might fail if it doesnâ€™t first check which slot the token is in.

 OpenJ9 now supports the use of an extra attribute, <tt>tokenlabel</tt>, in the SunPKCS11 configuration file on Linux on IBM Z, which helps to avoid this issue.</td>
