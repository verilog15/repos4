<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below. We're a small team and without all of this information it's not possible for us to help and your bug report will be closed. -->

**What package within Headless UI are you using?**

For example: @headlessui/react

**What version of that package are you using?**

For example: v0.3.1

**What browser are you using?**

For example: Chrome, Safari, or N/A

**Reproduction URL**

A public GitHub repo that includes a minimal reproduction of the bug. **Please do not link to your actual project**, what we need instead is a _minimal_ reproduction in a fresh project without any unnecessary code. This means it doesn't matter if your real project is private/confidential, since we want a link to a separate, isolated reproduction anyways. Unfortunately we can't provide support without a reproduction, and your issue will be closed with no comment if this is not provided.

You can use one of the starting projects on CodeSandbox:

- With React and Tailwind CSS: https://codesandbox.io/s/github/tailwindlabs/reproduction-headlessui-react
- With Vue and Tailwind CSS: https://codesandbox.io/s/github/tailwindlabs/reproduction-headlessui-vue

**Describe your issue**

Describe the problem you're seeing, any important steps to reproduce and what behavior you expect instead.
